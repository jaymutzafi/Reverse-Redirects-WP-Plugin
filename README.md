# Reverse Redirects Wordpress Plugin

This plugin provides a meta box in an individual page or post where you can enter urls that would redirect *to* this page (as opposed to away from it).

## Use Cases

For example, if you created a post or a podcast epsiode page and want to create easily remembered urls to link to which will land on this page, you can enter them on this page itself, instead of having to crete redirects elswhere. 

So if you have something like yourwebsite.com/podcast/episode-7, you can add a "/7/" url in the meta box and send pepole to yourwebsite.com/7 which will get them there.

## Needs some love

This is a plugin i made a while back, but it needs some updating. I'm posting it here in the hopes someone might find it useful and perhaps wants to pick up where i left off tweak it a little.
